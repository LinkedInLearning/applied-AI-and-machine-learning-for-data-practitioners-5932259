    "\n",
    "Welcome to this hands-on tutorial! In this notebook, we’ll be using Streamlit, a lightweight Python framework for building interactive web dashboards and AI apps — all with minimal code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 What is Streamlit?\n",
    "\n",
    "Streamlit lets you turn any Python script into a shareable web app using simple commands like st.write(), st.text_input(), and st.button().\n",
    "\n",
    "It's perfect for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Visualizing data and model predictions\n",
    "- Prototyping dashboards\n",
    "- Building AI-powered tools quickly\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 The Challenge in Google Colab\n",
    "\n",
    "Because Colab runs on remote virtual machines, we can’t directly access localhost ports like we would on our own computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "That means even if we run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "streamlit run app.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We still won't be able to visit localhost:8501 in our browser to view our application!\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3 Ngrok for Secure Tunnels\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this, we’ll use Ngrok, a tool that creates a secure tunnel from the internet to your Colab machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll use the following pattern for all of our Streamlit apps in this tutorial:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Start running our Streamlit apps on port `8051` (we’ll avoid `8501` to reduce potential conflicts)\n",
    "- Use Ngrok to expose port 8051 to a public web URL\n",

    "## 2.3 Streamlit Password\n",

    "\n",
    "> **Warning 🚨🚨🚨** Make sure to never share your Auth and API keys and be careful to avoid exposing them to the public especially when commiting files into GitHub! I've also setup a secure cleaup step to make sure we remove the `.env` file at [bottom of this notebook!](#final-steps)"

    "# Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you've explored multiple versions of the Explore California AI Travel App, here are some practical next steps to help you deepen your understanding and prepare your app for production use!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Explore the Codebase\n",
    "- Each Streamlit app (`RAG`, `LangChain`, `LangGraph`, and `Advanced LangGraph`) is fully open-source.\n",
    "- Inspect how components are defined, including embedding models, FAISS indexes, and LangChain/LangGraph workflows.\n",
    "- Pay attention to how state is managed across user sessions and how tools are composed in LangGraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Deploy to Streamlit Cloud\n",
    "- You can deploy any of the apps directly to Streamlit Community Cloud.\n",
    "- Make sure to include a `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file with your `OPEN_ROUTER_API_KEY` and any required credentials.\n",
    "- Optionally connect it to a GitHub repository to enable continuous updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Add Python Unit Tests\n",
    "- Create unit tests for key components such as:\n",
    "  - Semantic search functions (e.g., `search_locations`)\n",
    "  - Product matching logic\n",
    "  - ML-based predictions\n",
    "  - LLM formatting and parsing functions\n",
    "- Use `pytest` or `unittest`, and mock external calls (e.g., LLMs or FAISS) for faster test runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Refactor into Modular Components\n",
    "- Split large monolithic `app.py` files into:\n",
    "  - `models/` → ML model loading and prediction\n",
    "  - `tools/` → LangGraph tools and utility functions\n",
    "  - `components/` → Streamlit UI components\n",
    "  - `graphs/` → LangGraph workflows\n",
    "  - `services/` → LLM API interaction and embedding logic\n",
    "- This makes the codebase easier to test, maintain, and extend.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Extend the Application\n",
    "- Add multi-turn memory using LangChain agents or LangGraph memory nodes.\n",
    "- Add feedback logging or analytics to capture query usage and LLM performance.\n",
    "- Add multilingual support with translation layers or region-specific filters.\n",
    "- Extend ML product recommendations to use user history, clustering, or collaborative filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "By breaking the app into composable, testable, and deployable pieces, you're well on your way to building production-grade AI applications using RAG, LangChain, and LangGraph.\n"
